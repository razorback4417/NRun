# NRun
<em>Prediction Running App using Strava API<em>
Developed on the Snack platform. 

Using an algorithm developed with John Monz, AP Statistics teacher at Weston High School, and XC/track coach, we are able to use runner data to predict their 5k times during a race. The app scrapes runner data from respective Strava accounts, applies it to the algorithm, and outputs the projected race time.

The app has a social aspect to share and comment on predictions.
